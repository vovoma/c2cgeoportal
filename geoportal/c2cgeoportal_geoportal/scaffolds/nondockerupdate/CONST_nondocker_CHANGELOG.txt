Non Docker Changelog
====================

The new documentation consider that you use Docker, for non Docker specific usage you can use the old
documentation (version 2.2)

Changes you should do:
- In you project makefile include the nondocker-override.mk in place of CONST_Makefile.
- In your project vars file extends vars_nondocker.yaml in place of CONST_vars.yaml.
